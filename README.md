# What is this?

This is a stripped down C-only version of Darknet/YOLO. It was forked from old
C source code. Please see the following repositories links for background information, more
up-to-date information, or new development in C++.

* Development of Darknet/YOLO in C++ can be found here:  https://github.com/hank-ai/darknetcv/
* Old source code YOLOv4 - Darknet: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet
* About Darknet framework: http://pjreddie.com/darknet/
* Paper **YOLOv4**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10934
